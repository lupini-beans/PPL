This is a collection of programs that I wrote for my Principles of Programming Languages course.

MalSyntax contains the files for a language parser in C # for a made up "mini" assembly language
created by our professor. It parses the file and checks for syntax errors regarding commands
(confirming if they exist or not), and argument information, type and amount, depending on each valid command.

Lisp contains a series of Common Lisp programs to orient us with functional languages. The description of each
individual file is commented into the program. 

PostScript contains a business card, 3 smiley faces, an NFA, and a recursively built image.

Prolog contains relationship data for a family tree of Norse mythology, and a meal plan association.
